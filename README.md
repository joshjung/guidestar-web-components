# Guidestar Web Components

A collection of web components I built for fun / practicality and to learn.

## Sparkline

The goal of this mini-project was to build a mini-sparkline chart control, primarily to
render a waveform from an audio file.

This is a working project, see the `sparkline/README.md` for more details.

### Sparkline Demo

See [sparkline/README.md](https://github.com/joshjung/guidestar-web-components/blob/main/sparkline/README.md) for more details.
